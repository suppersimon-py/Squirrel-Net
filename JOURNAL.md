## 10/19/2025 10 AM - Intro and Design Considerations  

![SupperSimon.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM4MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--35758493b53c23baa459cf0f346f08c3996becdd/SupperSimon.png)
I am fascinated by all forms of decentralized communication, such as Amateur radio and Packet Radio, so when I learned about **LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network)** operating in part of the 33cm ham band (In the US) but requiring **no license**, I was hooked.

I started off with a **Heltec V3** and 2 custom **Raspberry Pi Pico** setups as client nodes and got a pretty decent range of **2.7 miles** off its 100mW transmit power, but with more nodes, I can have a much more spread-out mesh to cover more area.


## Design Considerations

### 1. Using the ESP32
- **Extensive community support** It's one of the most well-documented and supported MCUs available.


### 2. Communication
- **LoRa** SX1262 seems to be my best option, it has libraries and good enough documentation.
- **Wi-Fi, Bluetooth** Keeping Wi-Fi and Bluetooth integration simple, I chose the ESP32-S3FN8 for its onboard 2.4G Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.


### 3. Power Management
- **3.3V for MCU and communication** to keep it simple, I chose a linear regulator, the AP2112K-3.3.
- **Battery Management** I've used the TP4056 in the past with good results, when set up correctly, only requiring a resistor change to change the charging current limit.

Edit 10/19/25:
Just realized I didn't really explain the name.

My dad set our first home Wi-Fi SSID as Fat Happy Squirrel for 2.4G way back in 2008. And ever since then, it's always been some variation of Squirrel this Squirrel that.  

## 10/19/2025 3 PM - Power Management Schematic  

### Implemented USBLC6-2SC6, TP4056, DW01A, and AP2122K-3.3
**USBLC6-2SC6**
- ESD protection for the **USB-C** charging/data port using the USBLC6-2SC6 to protect both data lines and VBUS.

**TP4056**
- Manages charging current limit, set by pulling PROG to GND.
- I am using a solder bridge to allow me to switch between 400mA and 1A  charge current without resoldering resistors.


**DW01A**
- Battery protection IC used as an overcharge and over-discharge shutoff.
- Required 2 MOSFETs to close/open BAT- to GND.


**AP2112K-3.3**
- Regulates Battery output to 3.3V
- Switched EN pin

## 10/19/2025 11 PM - MCU + Wi-Fi Schematic  

### Added MCU + Wi-FI to my Schematic
I did my own calculations for the Wi-Fi schematic using a handful of datasheets as a reference.

design notes:
- added I2C bus for planned future additions.
- Buzzer for notifications.
- Reset button skipped as my power regulator is switched, so to reset, I can power cycle.

## 10/20/2025 11 AM - SX1262 Schematic  

I followed the reference schematic for the **SX1262** provided in the data sheet. Although I do not need the RF switch, I left it in to make it easier to impedance match later, following more reference models.

Reference schematic:

I set all values to reflect 915MHz used in the US. I may go through the effort of making different versions for other locations, but for now, my schematic is only for North America, South America, and Australia.

## 10/20/2025 3:27 PM - I2C devices added  

#### **GPS**
I will may replace this with an IC that allows for use of an external antenna.
**PA1010D Features:**
- I2C, Uart
- Embedded antenna
- Ultra High Sensitivity
- Positioning Accuracy < 3M
- Low Power Consumption, Acquisition 36mA, Tracking 28mA, Backup Mode 18uA

#### **OLED**
I chose something small 0.9" and cheap 2$, but should work just fine for my use.
**HS91L02W2C01 Features:**
- I2C
- 128x32
- Operating current 16mA

#### **Sensors**
Kept it simple with the BME280, it has plenty of library support for just about every use.

**BME280 Features:**
- LOW current draw, 3.6 ÂµA @1Hz
- Humidity, Pressure, and Temperature 

###### **LED**
The led is used on start up and as a "heart beat" indicator while turned on.

## 10/20/2025 8 PM - Updated Projects GitHub  

I wrote an automation to update the meshtastic firmware in my repo, build updated firmware, and release the .bin and the source in a .zip, so when finished, my repo will always have updated builds/source for people to recreate my project.

**Learned** basic automation for GitHub Repos, I have ideas for future projects that will really help on.

Updated **Licensing** to separate my work from **Meshtastics**

I improved **README**, still needs work

Started writing the **Variant File** for SquirrelCore

Renamed the project to "SquirrelCore" to better reflect my development process, like a squirrel I just jump without thinking of the consequences or skills required, but someone comes out unscathed, usually with another skill in my toolbelt.
