## 10/19/2025 10 AM - Intro and Design Considerations  

![SupperSimon.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM4MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--35758493b53c23baa459cf0f346f08c3996becdd/SupperSimon.png)
I am fascinated by all forms of decentralized communication, such as Amateur radio and Packet Radio, so when I learned about **LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network)** operating in part of the 33cm ham band (In the US) but requiring **no license**, I was hooked.

I started off with a **Heltec V3** and 2 custom **Raspberry Pi Pico** setups as client nodes and got a pretty decent range of **2.7 miles** off its 100mW transmit power, but with more nodes, I can have a much more spread-out mesh to cover more area.


## Design Considerations

### 1. Using the ESP32
- **Extensive community support** It's one of the most well-documented and supported MCUs available.


### 2. Communication
- **LoRa** SX1262 seems to be my best option, it has libraries and good enough documentation.
- **Wi-Fi, Bluetooth** Keeping Wi-Fi and Bluetooth integration simple, I chose the ESP32-S3FN8 for its onboard 2.4G Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.


### 3. Power Management
- **3.3V for MCU and communication** to keep it simple, I chose a linear regulator, the AP2112K-3.3.
- **Battery Management** I've used the TP4056 in the past with good results, when set up correctly, only requiring a resistor change to change the charging current limit.

Edit 10/19/25:
Just realized I didn't really explain the name.

My dad set our first home Wi-Fi SSID as Fat Happy Squirrel for 2.4G way back in 2008. And ever since then, it's always been some variation of Squirrel this Squirrel that.  

## 10/19/2025 3 PM - Power Management Schematic  

### Implemented USBLC6-2SC6, TP4056, DW01A, and AP2122K-3.3
**USBLC6-2SC6**
- ESD protection for the **USB-C** charging/data port using the USBLC6-2SC6 to protect both data lines and VBUS.

**TP4056**
- Manages charging current limit, set by pulling PROG to GND.
- I am using a solder bridge to allow me to switch between 400mA and 1A  charge current without resoldering resistors.


**DW01A**
- Battery protection IC used as an overcharge and over-discharge shutoff.
- Required 2 MOSFETs to close/open BAT- to GND.


**AP2112K-3.3**
- Regulates Battery output to 3.3V
- Switched EN pin

## 10/19/2025 11 PM - MCU + Wi-Fi Schematic  

### Added MCU + Wi-FI to my Schematic
I did my own calculations for the Wi-Fi schematic using a handful of datasheets as a reference.

design notes:
- added I2C bus for planned future additions.
- Buzzer for notifications.
- Reset button skipped as my power regulator is switched, so to reset, I can power cycle.

Full Schematic:

## 10/20/2025 11 AM - SX1262 Schematic  

I followed the reference schematic for the **SX1262** provided in the data sheet. Although I do not need the RF switch, I left it in to make it easier to impedance match later, following more reference models.

Reference schematic:
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzczMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2544cef5082cc9d9feb8bb6f3e50a7bd8aa1497a/image.png)

I set all values to reflect 915MHz used in the US. I may go through the effort of making different versions for other locations, but for now, my schematic is only for North America, South America, and Australia.

## 10/20/2025 3:45 PM - Full Schematic  

### I've finished the schematic and will be moving on to PCB routing.
I'd be interested if anyone has any recommendations on making the schematic look better (It's my first). Feel free to start commenting on the Repo

## 10/20/2025 8 PM - Updated Projects GitHub  

I wrote an automation to update the meshtastic firmware in my repo, build updated firmware, and release the .bin and the source in a .zip, so when finished, my repo will always have updated builds/source for people to recreate my project.

**Learned** basic automation for GitHub Repos, I have ideas for future projects that will really help on.

Updated **Licensing** to separate my work from **Meshtastics**

I improved **README**, still needs work
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzkxNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--81a61f7880b5c628ca5da345e152725f76dae314/image.png)



Started writing the **Variant File** for SquirrelCore

Renamed the project to "SquirrelCore" to better reflect my development process, like a squirrel I just jump without thinking of the consequences or skills required, but someone comes out unscathed, usually with another skill in my toolbelt.  

## 10/21/2025 - Planing + Routed Power Management  

First, may I ask how y'all feel about rounded traces? I both love and hate them so much.

All my components were selected since they can be provided by JLCPCB. Unfortunately, I don't have the tools required for at-home assembly, so the majority of my parts are getting the old pick and place treatment, but I'm saving the larger ones for by hand.

I'm still finalizing the bill of materials. For the power switch, I'm reusing 100pc faceplate mount switches I got some time ago for really cheap. 

I plan on mounting the switch in a depression on the outside, allowing the legs to pass into the case onto the switch pads for soldering, then have a almost cover slide over the switch into rails on the case, locking the switch into place and preventing accidental use of the switch

I don't really have any size requirements for my PCB, so I picked a decent 60x35 mm 4-layer PCB
for now, it's tame, but I'm sure as soon as I start work on data lines, it's going to get interesting

![SquirrrelCore.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzkzMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ecf139cd72c6dec6ea9b67b76ce726569f057499/SquirrrelCore.png)  

## 10/22/2025 2 PM - Routed SX1262 + MCUs Wi-Fi antenna  

My placement for the **SX1262** is a bit close to the Wi-Fi antenna, but it's a small board, and I'm already a bit lacking in room; therefore, I'm not expecting great results for Wi-Fi. All I plan on using the antenna for is the on-board Bluetooth, so high bandwidth is not really a requirement for my design.

I am keeping most of my data traces at 0.3mm. My power max consumption should only ever peak around 300mA, so my choice of 1mm (external layers only) power traces should be more than sufficient.

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUwMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0a1ad50cbf8f7da83485fea62fd2711603c45622/image.png)

The board is already starting to feel small. The remaining components will surely be fun to add and route.

I've been doing my routing without the Fab layer on..... Looks great, but I'll fix that next.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDQ2MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3699564e0bf8aa0bac63eb80f9728c7a5dad6b2c/image.png)

I exported my board as a .GLB and imported it into **Blender** for rendering. I'm also trying to relearn it since it's been a hot minute since I've used it for modeling, and I want to try and use it to build the case. 

I will not include the time spent working in Blender for renders of my board in the build time, since when I change values too fast with my preferred 2-cycled rendered port views, it just crashes.

For my layout of the **SX1262**, I used a reference (provided below) as just a starting place for my design; it really didn't help that much.

## 10/22/2025 9 PM - Built a small scene for project renders  

A simple box to make images and animations in
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU5NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0f6669a99d85ac9362d13d42946d041481db87b2/image.png)


I just made textured planes for the walls, a simple wooden plane as a floor, and a glass display base. I have a good GPU, so all my renders will be using Cycles rendering in 4K with 8000 samples, which looks great for all except the board. In my final iteration, I'll change the material properties for the board even further, hopefully getting a good result.

It renders decent images, but I believe it will look much better rendering videos of it rotating
 
Result:

I figured out why Blender was crashing so much:

37K faces
  

## 10/28/2025 1 PM - Almost finished the board design  

I've connected all components and am now just going through everything again to clean things up and check connections.

I've also decided to skip some components from the schematic since some power pins are so close to each other.

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjIzOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--815d79984f391e871f85f2e80a3a6ec097a10684/image.png)


I've made my BOM; however, I'm still trying to optimize it. The lowest amount of PCBs I can manufacture is 5, and I don't have the at-home capacity to assemble them, so it's gonna be more than anticipated for components and assembly.

I find it crazy that the PCB itself is so cheap compared to buying all the components:

## 10/28/2025 7 PM - Finding replacement parts for Out of stock components  

I'm my design, I used the Johanson-0900FM15D0039E in my SX1262 RF track, however, it's out of stock so I need to find a replacement
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjM4OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1a67899c013bc1cd55f6b31717fe6fa43d6f32b1/image.png)

Same with the pa1010d (GPS) being unavailable.

My current plan is to pass on the GPS (For Now) and just focus on my RF path.

I've also finished all my PCB routing and fixed all the connection errors. There were many.

## 10/29/2025 11 AM - redesigning the SX1262 Transceiver  

The saw filter (0900FM15D0039E) I was using in my schematic is out of stock, so I'm skipping it.

I'm currently working on using the SX1262 evaluation board as a reference; however, I will still need to come up with the component values.

And to top that all off, I'm sick while doing this :(

## 10/29/2025 2 PM - Updated SX1262  

This doesn't look nearly as clean, and I think I messed up the impedance matching, but I built a basic filter following the reference schematic and some values from other boards

## 10/29/2025 9 PM - PCB finished  

PCB routing done, and PCBs BOM done.

Updated the SX1262 for a more visually interesting appearance and a little more space optimization.

I'm now updating GitHub with the project files and finishing the hand-soldered components selection.

I skipped the BME280 for now since it costs so much for both the raw parts, and with it I would need to upgrade the standard assembly instead of the economical, so it's a win-win budget cut.
The current PCB/PCBA cost: ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjU5NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--83e999658b482485e17ae6e67e7de72c7ff6c05f/image.png)  

## 10/31/2025 - Almost Finished  

I have finished the bill of materials and got the final quotes for a minimum of 2 PCBA. To optimize cost, I omitted the BME280 in the PCBA.

I know it's more expensive, but I don't like the idea of cheaping out on batteries, so the few small components I'm not getting in the PCBA I'm getting off DigiKey instead of someplace cheaper.

While doing all this, I realized I had flipped the display pin header, so I fixed that. I'm really glad I caught that.

Estimated 141.07$ for 2 (cost optimized) boards
