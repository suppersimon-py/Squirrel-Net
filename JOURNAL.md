## 10/19/2025 10 AM - Intro and Design Considerations  

![SupperSimon.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM4MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--35758493b53c23baa459cf0f346f08c3996becdd/SupperSimon.png)
I am fascinated by all forms of decentralized communication, such as Amateur radio and Packet Radio, so when I learned about **LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network)** operating in part of the 33cm ham band (In the US) but requiring **no license**, I was hooked.

I started off with a **Heltec V3** and 2 custom **Raspberry Pi Pico** setups as client nodes and got a pretty decent range of **2.7 miles** off its 100mW transmit power, but with more nodes, I can have a much more spread-out mesh to cover more area.


## Design Considerations

### 1. Using the ESP32
- **Extensive community support** It's one of the most well-documented and supported MCUs available.


### 2. Communication
- **LoRa** SX1262 seems to be my best option, it has libraries and good enough documentation.
- **Wi-Fi, Bluetooth** Keeping Wi-Fi and Bluetooth integration simple, I chose the ESP32-S3FN8 for its onboard 2.4G Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.


### 3. Power Management
- **3.3V for MCU and communication** to keep it simple, I chose a linear regulator, the AP2112K-3.3.
- **Battery Management** I've used the TP4056 in the past with good results, when set up correctly, only requiring a resistor change to change the charging current limit.

### Implemented USBLC6-2SC6, TP4056, DW01A, and AP2122K-3.3
**USBLC6-2SC6**
- ESD protection for the **USB-C** charging/data port using the USBLC6-2SC6 to protect both data lines and VBUS.

**TP4056**
- Manages charging current limit, set by pulling PROG to GND.
- I am using a solder bridge to allow me to switch between 400mA and 1A  charge current without resoldering resistors.


**DW01A**
- Battery protection IC used as an overcharge and over-discharge shutoff.
- Required 2 MOSFETs to close/open BAT- to GND.


**AP2112K-3.3**
- Regulates Battery output to 3.3V
- Switched EN pin
